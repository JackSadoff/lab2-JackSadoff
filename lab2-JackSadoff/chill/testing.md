For testing chill.c, I attempted to trigger each condition on each if statement to catch faulty inputs to ensure that only valid inputs are accepted. Thisprogram is not set up to handle non-floating point inputs, however it is not specified that that is required. Attempting all of the examples from the assignment instructions yielded the same results as the code in the assignment.
